# COMP-6721-A.I.ducation-Analytics
COMP 6721 AAI Project to create A.I.ducation Analytics using CNN

# Project Description

- This A.I.ducation is a project to detect the student engagement during a lecture. 
- The main objective of this project is to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for facial expression detection and classify them into focused, bored, distracted, confused and neutral classes.
- Dataset to train this model is included in this Repository itself.

# How to Run?

1. Make sure you have Python and all the required libraries mentioned in Requirements.txt file installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository onto your local machine.

3. First run dataCleaning.py, which will resize the images and convert them into grayscale.

4. Then run dataPartition.py, which will partition the dataset into training, testing and validation directories.

5. Lastly run dataVisualization.py, which will create the distribution bar chart for all classes in dataset, 5X5 grid image which shows some example images of each class and also its pixel intensities. These all images will be saved inside Docs folder.
